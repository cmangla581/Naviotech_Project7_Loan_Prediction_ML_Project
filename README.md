Loan Prediction helps in predicting whther the loan of an applicant will get accepted or rejected, by using the k neighbors  Classifier, which makes the prediction using the euclidean distance of the neighboring plots.  
Also, the prediction is mainly made on features like the:

        2. Dependents 
        3. Employment Type 
        4. Applicant income

        6.Loan Amount  
        7. Loa Amount Term 
        8. Credit history 
        9.  Property Area 

    The Model Accuracy : 78.86 %
